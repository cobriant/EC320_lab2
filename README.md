## Download this Lab Assignment

Scroll to the top of this page and hit the green button that says Code and then hit Download Zip.

Find the file (probably in your downloads folder). On Macs, opening the file will unzip it. On Windows, you’ll right-click and hit “extract”. Then navigate to the new folder named EC320_lab2-main and double click on the R project EC320_lab2.Rproj. RStudio should open. If it doesn’t, open RStudio and go to File > Open Project and then find EC320_lab2.Rproj.

In RStudio, go to the lower righthand panel and hit the folder R. This takes you to the list of two exercises (koans) you’ll complete before Friday at 5pm.
