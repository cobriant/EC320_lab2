# EC320 Lab #2

In this lab, you'll learn about holding data in tibbles (tidy tables), you'll get an introduction to ggplot ("grammar of graphics" plots), and you'll take a look at how to use lm() to fit a linear regression in R.

Please get started on this lab early so you can get your questions answered either on Wednesday afternoon or Friday morning. Both of these will be treated like office hours:

Lab: Wednesday 4/12 from 4-5:20pm (Zoom link on Canvas)
 
Office hour: Friday 4/14 from 8-9am (Zoom link on Canvas)

Lab assignment 2: `K03_tibble` and `K04_qplot` are due Friday 4/14 at 5pm. Upload your knitted html files to Canvas under Lab assignment 2.

## Download this Lab Assignment

Scroll to the top of this page and hit the green button that says Code and then hit Download Zip.

Find the file (probably in your downloads folder). On Macs, opening the file will unzip it. On Windows, you’ll right-click and hit “extract”. Then navigate to the new folder named EC320_lab2-main and double click on the R project EC320_lab2.Rproj. RStudio should open. If it doesn’t, open RStudio and go to File > Open Project and then find EC320_lab2.Rproj.

In RStudio, go to the lower righthand panel and hit the folder R. This takes you to the list of two exercises (koans) you’ll complete before Friday at 5pm.
